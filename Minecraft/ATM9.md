## beginner gear guide and progression

* you can put a normal stone tools in crafting to turn them into silent gear then replace their parts

* copper rod gives 1.2x harvest speed which is one of the highest for early game
* Highest harvest speed multiplier is signalum (1.3x)
* pick head: iron > osmium > signalum > enderium > refined obsidian
* Gold tips is one of the best for pickaxe
* Redstone tip is better late game when the multiplier is higher than the flat (6) value of the gold tip
* Consider having an obsidian pickaxe for vein mining 

* Bones are one of the best for weapons
* sword blade: Iron > osmium > enderium 
* Put redstone tip on blade
* then go for morgan sword

## wannabees
- use biome compass to find a meadow biome, every tree there has a bee nest (100% chance)
- 
- Use advanced beehive with expansion
- bee keeper villagers are very useful (put unemployed villager next to advanced beehive) 

- get a sugarback bee by breaking mature coco beans. Make a wall of them and grow them faster with lily pads of fertilization, bonemeal or watering can
- Neon coocoo bee spawns about every 10 times a blue band bee comes out of its beehve. The blue band beehive can be made by crafting a sword with a dark oak log
- Right click nests with honey treats
- Breed the sugarback and neon coocoo to make the pepto beesmol

- piston the bees into a bottler then centeifuging the bottle to get genes. Combine bottles to get the 100% chance

- hoarder bee spawn eggs are made by bee conversion (need 10 bees, 10hopper and 10 shulker shells) right click normal bee with hopper then with shulker to make it hoarder bee

- need a shit ton of rancher bees (30)

- watch the last chapters of this video https://youtu.be/Ux1s7XheEGI?si=kd-ezro0ayzxEsl3 to setup the farms

## powah
automating it:
- put a crafter facing the energizing orb with a moduler router on top of it
- the moduler router should have a puller module then a redstone module that outputs the redstone signal into the crafter and then a sender module that sends them into a refined storage interface. the modules must be in this order
