## wannabees
* use biome compass to find a meadow biome, every tree there has a bee nest (100% chance)
* Use advanced beehive with expansion
* bee keeper villagers are very useful (put unemployed villager next to advanced beehive)

* Neon coocoo bee spawns about every 10 times a blue band bee comes out of its beehve. The blue band beehive can be made by crafting a sword with a dark oak log
* Right click nests with honey treats
