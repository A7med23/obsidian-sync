Think u can play god without permission?
Killing and combing those children
Bitch all out war for each of their cries
We aint like we wont just lie on our backs and die in an oven
Shoot, bomb, nuke we dont die
Martyrs marching six feet deep



Thought the painter was bad?
Well let me draw this picture for you
A sieged border relentlessly bombed
How different is that from an oven

Soon youâ€™ll be a relic of the past, yahoo
