The scifi series is about an alien race who’s planet is stuck in a 3 body system causing chaos.

But i think what the series is trying to show us is a multitude if “3 body problems” in our lives.

1) the 3 different views regarding the alien invasion (accepting it and trying to help it, hating it and working to fight it, or simply not caring and leavingit for the future generation to deal with) which reflects on how we deal with current global crises.
^^ this is the main premise of the show
2) a multitude of 3 body problems in the characters’ personalities leading to their actions being unpredictable and erratic
