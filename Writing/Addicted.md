Hate you but i cant let go of you
Everytime i wanna leave the thought of facing the dread outside snaps me back to you

This entanglement causing me too much mental strain
Is it worth it running from the pain
For a moment you wash my thoughts away like the rain
But will i ever actually get something out of you or is this all in vain
