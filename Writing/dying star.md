Ill be your shining sun in the sky
Dont backstab me it wont just be a scar
This majesty in front of u will turn to a dying star
will i silently burn out and collapse into a black hole
Or will I supernova your world away
A chance you dont wanna take a game u dont wanna play

Its a lose lose cause either its a black hole devouring all thats in its way
Or a supernove wiping ur world away
