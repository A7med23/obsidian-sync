the last vestige of hope is wiped

*add to the silence poem* blood under my bed ive slain all the monsters
Fire in my chest leftover from all the demons i murdered
Makin six digits in silence
Not in a year in a month(find a word that rhymes witb ence to replace ‘month’ here maybe)
Dont push me into violence
I can afford your soul
Each of ur organs alone or your body as a whole
Wipe you to a null (as in no one will find him in a government look up sight)

These walls around u?
None of yall can keep em
Cause if i gotta smash it all to dust
Burn jt all down

Fightin demons, i do it for a livin
One day ill turn this underworld to a heaven
But there’s one hauntin me, even i dread
It, stay away if u hurt me itll tear u to shreds


الشغف يحرك الهواة المسؤولية تحرك المحترفين و الفضول يحرك العباقرة

My reasons cut like knives

Had no time to choose what i chose to do
With myself a made a deal (adil ‘pronounce it like adele’)
Never check myself out no matter how bad i feel (fil)
Rolled too deep now im acquainted with the blue

Look
I dont tear pages from books
‘n i dont got nothing to lose
So out of my way I’d advise you to move
Got one reason left to draw my next breath
Go for it and I’ll make you wish for death
This smile’s got hell brewing underneath it
So don’t mistake this kindness for weakness

Can count on one hand those i care about
Take a bullet for them any day no doubt
Protect them with the last of my breaths
And I’ll kill if it gets desperate

Protected yall from it but no one thought about what it left inside of me (him and what he left inwide of me)
Im now my own villain


Scared to find a meaning
Cause maybe then ill be the one leavin

Dont mistake our peace for surrender
Over step and ashes your feet will be rendered

Take the pigment out my skin if that means i get to live

How many cheeks do we have to turn

You aint “neutral” youre dumb deaf and blind, a triplet

I think I’ve seen this before, and the ending wasn’t pretty
Didn’t notice it was dawning on me so swiftly(tswift)
If i ever (iver) give up …

Dont know if ill ever forgive u for taking yourself away
But my love for you isnt measurable and will forever stay

to be the best at anything, requires a lot of dissapointment

i remember my lessons and the people who taught me them

My eyes leaked as i achieved

the deeper i go the more hidden i am from the monsters outside
But in this solidarity i face my demons
Run from them outside then back down to them

Like the Devil in the face
Made it home safe

Your words cutting like knives
Your brains thinking like hives 

Dont wanna do this anymore
The party continues to roar
But im the only one on the dance floor

I aint legend i dont have the cure for what weve morphed into to
But our cards are on the table we’re both showing hearts

The rain pour i can feel the pain more
It used to wash it all away

I can feel my strings pulling outta the fabric of reality

All the war had me thinkin on my feet
Sad but somedays i wished u were dead beat

Love isnt a feeling, love is what we do despite what we feel

Thought we built a dynasty but you went MIA

Thought we built a kingdom but you went MIA
It all fell down

Keep your sterlings its a cold fucking winter

stacked but i feel broke
En inside
Been divide
Ed inside torn apart
Bleed my heart Out

Semicol on my middle finger movin on fuck you
(Thats how to fix the syllable problem in it)

Given them the ace on them to play hand

When they gove you medals, know its not for you


*Prod idea* -> “sounds of brakes throughout song where beat slows down or i stop speaking or smth until a point where I dont or beat doesnt die and the brakes are followed by a crash”


LAST EP WILL BE “LOST CAUSE”

  

Transition from “no sorries” a song where i show i am not sorry for anything i did to “mom” where i apologize to her and describe how im gone literally (checked out)

  

Last lyric in the outro “might randomly die might be my goodbye” song name “swan song”

  

FIRST EP IS BPD “Single is Hate you Dont leave”

*words for bpd*

Split/splitting

Polarizing

Idealize or devalue

  

SECOND EP IS “BUTTERFLY EFFRCT”

How i got the bpd

And what is its effects on my life

-> only needed 30% of love from parents (bar’s on the floor)

  

EP1 (SONG “countdown”)

*Countdown from either 10 or 20*

At 1 “one person’s all i need”

At 3 “three years spent with you”

  

  

EP 2 (SONG “January 13th”)

Not only the intro to this album but to my whole lifeq

  

*Song ends with “rocked asleep by the rhythm of my heartbeat”*

Then heartbeat sound plays and transitions into next song

  

EP 2 (SONG “*insert date*”)

*Dark deep beat*

I get a call he’s found on his bedroom’s floor

Grabbed my keys, ran to the door

Got to the hospital where is he does anybody know

In the OR there’s surgery he has to undergo

The clock on the wall tick-tick-ticks past four

Cuts too deep they’re struggling to stop the blood from hitting the floor

Cmon bud hold on I can’t spend our forever alone

Cmon bud hold on don’t abandon me you too

*flatline with “tooooooo”*

  

*after flatline*

Parents school money and a whore

his life he couldn’t take anymore

  

*continue verse rhyming “oor” and maybe another syllable but to faster and faster*

  

*have the heart beat machine sound in the background and then flat line in the end*

  

*reach peak speed at the end before going silent with the flatline* 

  

*beat playing with heart beat in the background then you say “corrupted” and the lyrica and beat glitch out into nothing.

Now only the flatline is left with an atm sound and then a quote if a doctor saying “time of death: xx:xx” then slowly build up or another beat drop*

  

*in a song end the lyrics with “the clock’s ticking” and have a clock sound fade in and then beat fades out leaving the clock sound behind*

  

USE ARC NORTH REVOLUTION BEAT STYLE

  

USE NEINI DEMONSW FOR FLOW

Meky Joker senic shahyn (mention wegz being the smartest)

*****

They think they playing god
Fuckers forgot we bleed the same blood

There will be a time that’s the last youre ever thought of

See u in the day’s haze
(Dancing in the kitchen in the day’s haze)
U could call me heydaze
Cause i might just call u my new religion

I gave you the world while mine collapsed. Dont you dare utter about loyalty to me

  

“Puce”

  

“She thundered”

  

Teat me like mekamuru
Fix me just to tear me apart again

  

Brass spitfire, air swallowed metal, and lead took its first taste of iron calcium iron and diet (describing a gunshot)

  

If sight was speach, my eyes didnt have the words to describe what it saw

  

The help im getting is losing the race against my failing mind

  

*thing* Never to be made by a healthy human *body part*

  

“Most people dont know pain like that, they never will. And if they did, it would end them. But the people who dig in. The ines whi keep survivng those are the ones you cant beat. Thise are the ones no one can bear. Cause once youve weathered a storm like yours you become the storm. You hear me? You. Are. The storm. And jts the rest of the world that needs to run for cover” -vera

  

He’s smart he’s angry
Put that shit together you stay the fuck out the way

  

Go back to your bathroom and shit some more
Cause ure still full of it

  

No one will ever know the violence it took to be this gentle

  

A star that once pierced the darkness
Becomes the darkness

  

When life gives tou lemons huh?
Well life never gave lemons

  

Adhd is time myopia

  

Standing in the ashes of who i used to be

  

Compartmentalizing the pain
Living in the distraction

  

My anger aint dying with me
You cant stop whats coming for you

  

Only time i feel in control is when im gripping your steering wheel
Burying the pedal hoping it buries me

  

You never loved me
Im just an extension of your own ego

  

Now you see me standing but you havent seen my falls
Now you hear my engine roar but you havent seen the stalls

  

And as the twilight hues 

Your respite dues

  

Flying down the highway in a machine fueled by emotion

I bury the pedal like i do my feelings

And that engine lets out the scream i can’t

  

Take a gamble that love exists and do a loving act

  

Not shady but am not afraid to stay in the shadows 

Taking steps

  

My answer rhymes with this doe

F u hoe

  

Situation’s dire
My exhaust’s on fire

  

Don’t push me to violence Been looking for an excuse to use it

  

Loudest one in the room yet the loneliest

  

Im on the road now more than im home
Still i find its only you on my mind

  

Gone for eachothers jugulars

  

Only trace left of me will be the nos smell and a dust cloud

  

Just make the right adjustments at half time

  

If our demons can’t dance then neither can we

  

3 phases idealize demonize humanize

  

In a piss fight and this is the splash zone

  

Got demons checking on me daily

  

A serpent got me waiting for a wedding that was my funeral

  

Demon plagued

  

Got the devil’s eyes

If you believe in a god, start sending ur cries

  

“Make me happy”, fate i dared

  

Got to the summit still going higher

  

A twisted realm of emotions

  

Know i look like an angel but this halo can get very dark
Watch out cause you i wouldnt hesitate to slay
This aint satire, this aint south park (MMMKAAYYY) *play the professor’s sound

  

Grab the love handles with both hands, depress the triggers with bott thumbs and ull have her screaming in no time

  

Exitstence

  

Deep angry red pulsating with unknown energy

  

Got demons have em in chains
Dont lemme u leash
These hell hounds soulbound

  

But when i wake up in the morning it’s so hard to breathe the air

  

Ankle screaming louder with every move

  

Ill waer high heels so you can here my approach on the cobblestone and have time to repent

  

Why did you shoot him 14 times? I ran out of ammo

  

Saw the chord give life to a newborn
Saw it take life from the mother and give it to him
And saw it choke the life outta him

  

Home more of a war zone than a sanctuary

  

Learned early to tip toe around the landmines (didnt i walked staright into them)

  

Wearing a smile that ddidnt reach his eyes

  

The lowest caliber of human beings to have drawn breath

  

Praying not to lose sight of why i started 

  

The wind biting theough my thin jacket

  

Broken people save broken people

  

Its not me its Patricia

  

Too acquainted with goodbyes but yours stll killed me

  

We were two halves of a broken whole, bound by a silent understanding of shared pain.

  

Voice training with restrained panic

  

Physically and mentally spent

  

Tenacity’s a superpower

  

Eyes old with wisdom he knows id rather not have

  

Gaslight till burned out feelin like a blunt

  

Got demons, only they are allowed to hurt me
Touch me and theyll burn thee
Theyll turn on you, burn you, if u even think of touchin me

  

Call me evolution the way i tinker

  

Are we so helpless against the tide

  

The inly thing seperating us is a few choices
Some made by us some made for us

  

Tell me i could be happy, i could be content
But that aint the real me, just a glimpse of what coulda been
The real me’s bitter and ugly

  

Why build us up yo crumble and fall

  

Each new face letting me know again its real
Each sad expression a tiny echo of the pain inside
The pain hit me again, this time without the anesthesia of shock

  

The world has taken too much from you for you to be considered a child

  

I came in peace
You came in wrecking like Miley

  

I wonder where you are
I wonder where you’re going (the kids grandma)

  

Stare the abyss in the eye and dare it to blink

  

To fight monsters, we created monsters of our own

  

Kept raising didnt wanna fold on you
Was forced to all in and the hand you gave me was a seven deux
Y dealt me a sept duex ‘n i still all inned for u

  

Its lonely when ure mind’s a pot spitting meals others dunno how to taste

  

Depression collapses time
You find your whole days blending together into one endless suffocating loop

  

How many friendly smiles seen turn into flowers in front of a tombstone 

  

Did i fly too high
Is this my fall from grace
Or was i never up there in the first place

  

Got lost trynna save what we have
Tried finding me afterwards lost you in the process

  

Bridges aint worth shit if u demlosh then right after

  

Tip toe love

  

Ashes of my passions

  

Thought id see you again
Now i cant bare the pain
Going insane

  

How do you cope
When all they gave you was hope
Just to snatch it away with ur soul

  

Y’all haters are heathens
Wouldn’t believe even if i split you see (moses splitting the sea)
Drown you in your sorrows
Youre the slaves you aint no pharoahs

  

Ive seen at twenty shit people see at forty

  

Livin on autopilot missed tge exit

  

Cant fix broken people
You either fix a bird’s wing and it flies
Or you don’t and in your hands it dies

  

Filled everyone’s cup now am feeling empty
Now that I’ve dried up now they’re getting angry
*word play on bartender ‘tender’*

  

A lifetime filling cups feelin empty
Day in day out battling anxi

  

All those sticks
Its hard to taste the carrot

  

Spent nights waiting for a name with a ringtone
It came too late my screen was already shattered

  

Write song about psychosis and use jinx

  

Dead man walking 
My dead friend’s talkin

  

Sittin by your grave
For this day I was never ready
Living my life trynna leave a legacy
The weights are getting heavy
And i look at you and i wonder
You were loved dearly
But now youre gone and the wind blew
And every string you wove fell through
Is it all really worth this entropy

  

Aint no monsters under the bed
All hiding up in my head

  

These demons might be haunting me
But they still answer to me 
If i unleash it will be ugly

  

Face the wrath of the real of me

  

I love you but i dont wanna pass down what was passed tk me
If i somehow someday resolve them id love to have you definitely 

  

Fell in love at first site and you too (U2 adlib)
Every dog on the street
Knew we were in love with defeat

  

Great art comes from great pain
But at that point whats there to gain
Other than fortune and fame
And when its too much and u’re going insane
*And when im at the all time low mentally
Do i try to fix the thing that got me he

	

Everything ive done was to make you happy 

  

and smiley
All youve done was come in wrecking like miley

  

You gambled and lost the bet
And now ure here full of regret

  

Screamed my fucking lungs out
Yet the sincerity of my pain you still doubt

  

Was born with a gift
That would later be my curse

  

Made my own make believe
Dragged myself into it for relief
My brother grew order and i felt responsibility
Snapped myself back to reality
Knowing how hard it will be
To face this choas around me

  

Cut throat
Hang you like a raincoat 

  

Heart’s bleeding out with every beat *repeated from below but variation*
Lungs’ suffocating with your every word

  

Lemme carry this future convo right now
My life’s turned full circle from all the corners I’ve cut for you
Stuck in a damned cycle trying to please you
Then I spiraled out of control ‘n what did you do

  

Lift me up then throw me like you did him

  

Everything’s out the window now
What hanger are u gonna hang now
Who’re u gonna blame now

  

If this wound heals without you
If a scar puts it back together and makes me someone new
Would say we’ll regret it but honestly
Itll only be me cause ‘course aint nothing wrong with what you do

  

My compromise has been taken for weakness for far too long

  

Care for the clock
Tick tock

  

So far from being broke ye
But so fucking far from bein’ okay

  

Weight on my shoulder’s to heavy that my eyelids are too hard to lift up in the mornin

  

Everything i had all gone
Lost in a war targon

  

Dancing to the beats of war

  

Remember
Ecochamber

  

The slightest demon bothering me
Could burn your whole family tree
Am a wolf (ref to zayde wolf ‘gladiator’)
Spent too much money on a therapist
Couldnt fix me I accepted it

  

for you, everything i was ready to sacrifice
But no matter what i do it just never sufficed

  

alone
At all

  

A childhood spent in vain

  

The pot’s brewin off the fire you lit
And all uve done to fix it was abandon it
Well it didnt go off and now youre facing it

  

 My heart’s as empty as this hall see (halsey)
Someone will love you but someone isnt me

  

Heart’s bleeding with every beat
Still fighting after the screen’s said defeat

  

Met so
Schizo
Meds o

  

Please fail me not
Ive given all that i got

  

Wont spend my last breath
Building a monolith

  

Lost ‘n found, nemo

  

Trynna keep the ship from sinking
But does it really matter
Will the waves ever stop limping
‘N on the beach not splatter

  

  

The tension’s here bigger than donna and harvey

  

Ill do you shady…
… killshot

  

You burned your bridges
Why should i keep mine

  

Last thing im holding in to now’s
A candle in the sky for the lost ones

  

This might not be escapism 
But i dont wanna feel how my heart js rippin

  

Ay ay captain
Ill swallow it up again
But this sponge’s boutta pop

  

Spent the weekend in paris (pronounce it in french)
The city’s gold ‘n empty
It’s lights were blindin me

  

Life is pain
Everyday you spent and will spend’s in vain
Nothing’s left to lose and nothing’s there to gain
Not much mental left to retain

  

Wasnt love that brought us together
It was the pain
‘n when I healed her, we got severed

  

Your face cant stand these shoes

  

Take your face off
Leave u dead in a cage

  

Legend of the fall (pitt)

  

Strange how things got out of hand
Not my first ‘n not the last verse

  

Sin city’s cold ‘n empty
Its light’s startin to blind me

  

Living life in adversity
Everything I’ve built
Came in wreckin like Miley
Survivin by the humor I find in tragedy

  

  

Learned fear very early on

  

Is this just panic 
Or am j going manic

  

Keep digging in my head
Youll find a mind with no ore(mine)

  

My compassion ‘n love 
Put me in a deep trough

  

A ship sailing in a grateful sea
Sun setting
One man crew

  

A warrior i was born
But of the chance of battle i was torn
So I wage this war on my own
Walk down this path all alone

  

Moon by my side
Lemme tell you a secret tonight
This body’s but a facade
To voices lurkin up inside
My head lemme show you where they reside

  

All i did with this shit was always swallow
But in this misery i cant forever wallow

  

  

You aint dope but ill smoke you

  

You see me standing in the light
But you haven’t seen the darkness i came out of
Saw the highest highs and the lowest lows

  

When everyone’s making it worse,
Even ones that want to help you
Dont have a damn clue what to doe

  

Seen all kinds of drugs from all kinds of outlets
Needles lines ‘n pills

  

Had em all at disposal
Needle line or pill
Never have never will

  

Lonesome in dienfall
Abandkned by the same people for whome every breath you take

  

This body’s a facade to the voices inside

  

Sometimes to love someone
You have ti be a stranger

  

Think you scare me?
Think you can challenge me?
Bitch i call on the banshee(s)
Late at night when it’s lonely

  

  

*add jordan peterson intro of him saying you have ti be aware of how monsterous you can be*
Gave you my trust but that opportunity you blew
Had to show you the devil inside me can do
Took off the last layer no one’s seen through
Not leaving any perspectives for you to skew
Go ahead cry around tellin em you knew
All along thats who i am it was only overdue
Might’ve given you love but after learnin smth new
Not to have someone truly special
All ingredients in this cauldron to brew(stew)
Can keep steering with or without you

  

  

A  soldier ‘gainst paining drowning in his own

  

Oh the eternity thought we’d spend together
My bad only fools think anything lasts forever

  

Dreams die in suffering and i lost mine
Decided to carry the burden of helping those suffering
And my own i dont really mind
Maybe purpose or happiness there ill find

  

  

Got any clue how much i gotta relearn?
How many realities i needa discern
Asking me how much trust’s there to earn?

  

All you did was decieve
Me and make me believe
It’s forever and my dreams you ripped and cleave(d)

  

  

I know the issue issue
My world’s full of  color
You live in black and white
I either point at what you see white and we’re tight
Or what i point at you see black 
And here communication’s lack

  

Spending years in someone’s shadow
What did you expect that foreshadows?
“Wasnt taught to calm”, well
Was i taught not to yell
Was i taught to not let loose to hell
To not storm out after every fight
Close the door sit alone turn off the light

  

  

Now dont keep trying to get to my head
Youre banging on lucifer’s den
The door might break and there’s demons you really dont wanna meet then
Battlin then daily and keeping it to myself
Not much left here to mend
Dont bother yourself
Barrel to my head, heart on the trigger
If i cant beat em i sure as hell aint joinin them
I can point at my every mistake
Can recite my every flow
But keep sayin i act victim
Cant say i dont care 
Just got too little emotions left to share
Suffocating the toxicity i can’t bear

  

  

  

Dont talk to me about my pace
Been awake for days
Hands still shaking
Heart still aching
Will seems to be breaking

  

  

ReChing out but they all seem ti be blind

  

Keep saying im acting victim
Words sound like theyre coming out a rectum

  

  
Hand still shaking
Heart/brain still aching
Still facin demons

  

My hands are shakin
My heart’s still achin
My will seems to be breakin
But off the gas im never takin
My leg off never brakin

  

You sit and you wonder
Where did it fall through
where did you blunder
Is it my bad letting my guard down

Giving u control of your feelings
Is my bad i didnt manipulate
To every thought of my mine make you relate
every thought of yours make you debate
Bend and twist to latch you by a hook

  

I look in the mirror i see you
Talking to myself i hear you
And it terrifies me

  

Asking me why i dont try?
A fish askin its neighbor why dont you fly

  

See you in my mirrors
Hear you in my thoughts

  

Not a peoduct of you ‘n aint you
Might be a product of you but i aint you
Might be a product of you and might be you
But i pray my awareness saves me
Pray i find someone like you found
Pray i see the good in them and cherish it
Pray i get to shut the flood gates keepin me up at night
Pray i could raise kids and give em my might’’
Pray i could make em use it to flourish
And not fight’’
for their sanity
Watch them shine so bright
Like i couldve
And not remind them everyday of what wouldve
Pray i learn to stop bbefore its too late
Think a thousand times before i spew out hate
Pray i dont have to live holding on to a dagger in too deep ‘n its too late
to pull it out

  

cant feel myself the toxicity’s suffocating

  

My heart’s on the trigger

  

I wanna live not just survive

  

Id say i hate you from my heart but i aint got one
Hate you from the depths of the void in my chest

  

You think you know heartbreak?
Fuck a lover, its when your wake up call
Is you being alone in your fall

  

Shoulders heavy yea
But from the weight of this crown on mah head

  

Changed who i am to please who youve always been and will always be
Changed what i do
Changed my company
Changed my activities
Still lost
Still angry
Still
Still
Still am to blame
Guess the more things change the more they stay the same

  

Trust me is better if i don’t face my demons
Cause if i do, ill have my reason
To make you pay for all the treason
Let the dark deepen
Its murder season

  

I hide behind humor put on a smile like a curtain
The more you see me laugh the more you should know that im hurtin
Lived my life tryin not to be another burden
Worst you coulda done… was make me feel like one
Scorched all my bridges and with you want me share them?

  

  

The tinnitus going shhh trynna silence the voices out

  

Am the load in the dice

  

God always gives us a mirror to look at
Doesnt have to be hanging from the wall
Could be standing face to face with u in a hall

  

You were so easy to love
But i guess our love wasnt enough

  

Howd u build me up just to let me go

  

A fish cant teach a bird how to fly

  

Watched needles shot up veins
Watched people shot up friends

  

Going through cycles
Peaks and rock bottoms
Never broken just bent
‘n Now am hell bent

  

This aint a clash of titans
Im smashin your giants

  

Lonely in ur company 

  

Marching to the ending with longer strides

  

Fallin off the wagon.. beggin
u to stay

  

Thought i was at the top of my world
Turns out i was stuck in a basement

  

The inly thing consistent in my life is the screen time notification i get every sunday

  

Dont need to love myself i do
I need to learn how to stop hatin it too

  

I stare into the night and wonder
If forever alone ill wander

  

(Will die) Dead with my heart on the trigger

  

No face for you to save, hannible

  

Loose if a
Lucifer

  

Not polyamouros but ill take all of u fuckers out at once

  

Dont bring up my issues unless youre gonna deal with your own

  

Stones pilin on my neck ‘n aint looked at medusa

  

Phone used to blow up till i blew it all up

  

Askin me to heal, done deed but im scarred

  

The wounds left scars
The less i treated em the worse the scars

  

Im a lost boy
Not from neverland

  

Goes the clock
Eyes locked
Everyone watching room’s full o’ hawks

  

Lost it all
Looking the fall in the eyes

  

DONT MAKE ME FACE MY DEMONS

  

Fucker’s at the back of my head
Tellin me this aint the end

  

I treat people like these(theeez) beats(beeets)
Switch up on them (ooown em)
*alternate between random flows, including fast and long O*

  

Looking at my years like they’re running out (or I’m out of them)

  

A burst of happiness
Now in hits the loneliness
In come the voices (vo-voices)
Tellin me im useless(use-useless)

  

Im not fine
And I hate you but i want you to care

  

Thought you were my heaven on earth
But all o’ ma skeletons you’ve unearthed
Thought my kids by you will be birthed
But now that image’s so cursed

  

No apologies, nah fuckers am not sorry

  

Aint actin victim but i also aint the attacker(attakah)
Yet ive always been the victor(viktah)

  

*talking to my brain*
All i wanted was to save you
I know
To protect you
I know
But look at me now
Allergic to love
To anybody’s touch

  

No breaks fuck a kitkat

  

Feeling like im dyin of thirst

Watching myself drown 

  

Empty days filled eith loneliness
Losing my mind in the silence
Only thing keepin me company’s tinnitus 

  

I wanna be loved the way i love
Want them to give me the world and still think they aint done enough
Wanna be held and told im enough

  

Life aint stoppin 
But idk hawta keep goin

  

Late night splittin
On your image spittin
Against the wall my head hittin
For your company beggin

  

Bitch im crazy
Ill tear you apart
‘N eat up your heart
It wont even phase me

  

Most valuable things in our lives we got for free
Most trivial things we got after spending sprees

  

You cheating fucking bitch
Stay and my poor soul dont ditch

  

Need someone to love and protect me from the world. But when theyre close i run

  

History is filled with liars
If he lives and you die
His lies become the written truth
Cause all u need to change the world
Is one good lie and a river of blood (cpt price)

  

U might be better off alone
But ure not the alone
Ure not the only one with this shit to hone 

  

Dont care dont empathize
Stick my d** between her thighs
Make her lick her own demise
Make her pay for all the lies
Bitch am a king on the rise
Trynna stop me ill bury one between yo’ eyes

  

Balto e9 min6

  

Brick by brick i will (smith)
Tear it all down

  

Rip rip rip rip you apart
Praying we’ll never grow far apart
Tried usin you to fill a hollow heart
Left me in pieces as u depart

  

Too easy to forget all those pasts
Cant hide all the scars

  

*talking to the mask i made for myself*
I know who you are I fucking made you
Just like i made 10s of u for everyone i knew
Dont try and fool me I am you
I know you perfectly fit I fucking tailored you
Measured every inch every detail
Wrapped u around to tell a tale
That’ll lure em into what they don’t know’s hell
Trynna keep em around
Then chase em out like a hound
its all I fuckin do
A human catch 22

  

I can be okay till u take over(the mask/my other side)

  

Got an arsenal of characters
Can call on stage on demand

  

  

*interlude or verse idfk*
Ask urself
Did she just actually abandon you
Did she just forget
Or was it
Did u keep wearing and tearing till there’s nth left
Did u keep pushing till she eventually failed the test
Were they actually bad parents
Or were u a disaster deserving to be on the shelf
Look at you
All that talent and genius
And Ure state’s so hideous
Cant keep a hand to hold

  

Look yourself in the fucking mirror
Maybe ure not always the victim
Maybe ure the serial victor 
Maybe ure actually un fucking bearable
Maybe relationships with you are fuckin terrible
Maybe holding on to you’s fuckin horrible
Despite all the effort uve put in
All the good intentions u had
Despite taking your all that uve given
Uve imagined too much flavor when its all bland

  

  

From an early age i was cursed/blessed with rage

  

Promise forever
Say u love me
Say u want me
Well we shall see
But most likely 
Itll end up like halsey
Someone will love you
But someone isnt me

  

Im trying my fucking hardest
But im hurting everybody regardless

  

Unbearable
terrible

  

Not michael but ill jack ur son

  

Run the beat ill switch up ooooon ya
Feelin catatooonic yea
Cartooonic
Spit it
Hit it
*fast lines*
“Mention the swap in flow/cadence”^

  

Walk through the ashes of my passions

  

*rewind* -> wish i could rewind after every impulse, after every intrusive thought, after every betrayal

  

*no cure* just learn to cope (bpd)

  

*project disorder* -> say “ure witnessing the nado from a butterfly effect(a butterfly’s wings)” in one of the songs”

  

*song where i spam whisper “its ok its ok”*

  

Someone will *…..*
Someone isnt me/you

  

My life’s fallin apart 
My fault or their’s i cant tell
L o l

  

Bell’a dingin
Gun slingin

  

Intense short lived its all my fault

  

See your face in every turn

  

Eligible for assissted suicide
Diagnosed with bpd

  

Got a lotta chances i gotta use
(A lotta potential to let)loose
But a grip on life growing loose
Nothing to lose
But i need some kinda boost
Cause all i want rn is my neck wrapped with a noose
Only future i see imagine is my neck wrapped with a noose

  

A life ends another starts
Ive seen both sides

  

Too many demons in my head
Used to hide and play dead

  

Took me full of life and left a Corpse of me
You went ti sybstances i went to college

  

Ive seen better days
Fall from grace
Ir never there in the furst place

  

I fire like an mg hit like a sniper

  

At the front if my mind
He’s at the back of her throat

  

Too much pain in my chest struggling to numb it
Yet chilling at a rock bottom thats your summit

  

How many days am i gonna feel this for
How many nights am i gonna confide in the darkness behind my eyelids

  

Id lose my mind in the silence
Thank god for the tinnitus 

  

Demons cant bury or drown
Mole diggers learned to swim

  

Weights too heavy scared itll but me
Used to fly so high now git a pair of broken wings on me

  

Heart’s beating too fast inside of me
Left to bleed

  

Everything ive built turned to ashe ‘n
Nobody cares till im lashin
With demons in my head am clashin

  

You think i aint honest?
Bitch i pinky promised

  

Bitch im a killa
This aint a meta
Phor

  

  

زنقة صحة و زنقة فلوس و زنقة نفوس

  

I dont shed tears i shed my skin

  

  

Floored the pedal on an endless highway 
A part of me wants to crash it

  

Been just picking up the haste
Pedal’s floored with no gas
Swear a part of me wants to crash

  

My pedal’s floored 
My gas’s runnin out
What else do i do
Navigating through this mess i grew into

  

You cant hurt/disappoint me its all ive knwn

  

Pedal floored running outta gas
But i aint slowin down

  

Like me huh?

Lemme show you what its like
Dying every waking moment

  

Its rainin pourin
Aint writing my own ending

  

The closest to tired i was rubber
Hit rick bottom bounced off

  

*song idea: ten*
The whole song is just counting to ten while saying hardships/hope

  

Wanna leave a legacy
But u look down at my leg i see

  

Intentions (program your brain)

  

Demons all around me gotta gun down
Ceilings stacked up gotta tear down

  

My hands tied
His hands all over her

My lips sealed
Her lips grippin him

  

Was one leg in a grave one hand grippin faith
She was gripping dick

  

Im trynna grab onto any hope
She’s grabbin on his dick

  

Im worse than a decease
Fire i dont cease
Till all’s deceased

  

Im lost and weary

  

Was in first place
Stopped running
And saw everyone else go past

  

Lived subzero
Below rock bottom my heart froze

  

I was addict iid
To a sick piig

  

Tried drowning my demons they learned to swim

  

The lower i got on gas the harder i pushed the pedal 

  

The kid in me what if wrong
The teen in me ready to defend

  

You could be on fire and on you i wouldnt piss
Turbulance

  

Heard the banshee calling my name i fucked her

  

Pens a gun never holst it without firing

  

Are my own heart out
Want any good for this heartless world

  

The older i grew the more it brew

  

Bitch i got here from 6 feet below
The ground

  

Was stuck in a daze 
Lost track of the days

  

Dont need no one ive got an army
Of voices in my head draggin me

  

Swear on the breath that i breathe

  

Till my pulse flat

  

Shoot for the moon? I had it in my hands
But now its in someone else’s sky

  

Let loose the hounds 
Hellbound

  

Ask for prayers from your mother
Farewells from your brother
Cause when i get a hold of your face ill smother

  

  

Heard the banshee callin my name
Called her back

  

I see my bless but my curse too

  

The legend if the angry blonde lives on through me

  

What am i gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in the trailer park

  

Too much epi in my veins no iv

  

My ambition’s limitless
My power’s infinite
I can do anything
Surprising how limiting that can be

  

Was broken and barely breathing
Yet tore down every curling
Ceiling 

  

Figure out the rules they change

  

Not spiderman but ill run the miles more or less(moralis)

  

Cause am an empe empe empe ROR!

  

Needa rewind to before i… floored it

  

Am a wolf but no masks on

3 lettrrs mia

  

Adrenaline rushin through my veins no IV

  

A warrior who learned to love the pain (add a score reference)

  

Are you okay? Please stop askin if im okay
How can i be alright aint no way

  

Calling my bluff?
Know what happened to the last guy who did that thinkin he tough?
Yea his family dunno either

  

*chorus*

An cold… take me to where I was told…
Where all this would end and
Id sleep the night at home

  

Look into your ryes and listen to your lies

  

Telling me to slow down but i got no brakes, Ken miles

  

“Close your heart for their desperation,
Close your heart for their suffering,
Dont allow yourself to feel for them,
They will not feel for you”

  

Killed the predator of my spirit
In the desert of my soul
Ive had enough
Breaking my heart trynna be enough

  

My trust don’t break it
Or your neck I’ll break it

  

Am morally bankrupt
I think ill fucking erupt

  

A lart of me thinks i love being broken

  

  

  

Aint a king bitch an an emper(or)
Faced a lion didnt ohase me the roar
My battle cries are a lions roar
In a conqueror

  

Life’s got her weapons out
Am a warri (or)

  

Ehat youre witnessing is the effect of a butterfly
Youll hear it anither time

  

Never had the time to fake it
Was always the first to make it

  

Heart’s frozen but this ice dint break

  

Writer producer dentist coder graphic designer name it
Aint a throne i saw and didnt claim it

  

Living on autopilot
Yelling inside but I’m quiet

  

This is the part if me that you’ll never take away frim me

  

Chick ify
Palms itchy

  

How are these people so blind to see the fl(aws) that are in (us) 

  

Love i dint believ in
The hills of life we skeein (joe’s death)

  

The dream is forever 
Let us dream together

  

Cant count the nights I’ve spent hurting
Thinking why I’m not enough
Cant count the hours i have put in
To rebuild myself
So don’t talk to me about the times we were close in

  

  

Buying and selling me like its arbitrage

  

Thought you were my life support but turns out i was your
 All you wanted ti di was pull the plug

  

Maybe im done maybe ive lost

  

There were days where i had sleep for dinner 

  

Begging me to stay

  

As long as those legs arent in these shoes
Better shut the fuck up hoes

  

*chorus*
Take a moment of silence
*I say my line*

  

Dont stand to me hoe
You cant handle my wrath 
Wont spit ill spray you with a firetruck hose

  

*lyrics* 
But its okay its gonna get better
No way this lasts forever… Right? (Beat drop)

  

Keep pushin me
I’ll kamikazeee crash (rhyme kamikaze with pushin me)

  

Hope’s whats left when all’s gone
Ironic

  

I was right there in your darkest times
Where were you when off went my lights

  

Watched you go from happy to miserable (about me)
This comeback’s personal

  

Made friends with the monster

  

I miss you(missio)
Sing to me

  

Problems dividing like theyre in a petri

  

Dont pay your critiques to try ‘n break me
Got a inner one that does it for free

  

I watched you give up on me

  

Grew up a little too fast
Miss when i couldnt care less

  

  

Does it get better or am i staying empty forever

  

Not admitting
Kitten
Vision

  

Here i go its my shot
Feet fail me not

  

Stuck next to a phone 
Waiting for calls i’d never get
Now i gotta move on
Choices aint plent i gotta forget

  

At the point where im praying for hope

  

Bitch i run your world

  

Where’s the friend ive known since i was just a kid
Together we played and in each other we hid
Couldnt say goodbye but cant bare the hi either

  

Buried every demon
Tore down every cielin

  

Started with wings that were broken(butterfly)

  

Best in me
Abandon me
Father further

  

Pain’s getting louder voices going quieter

  

Thoughts cutting in my mind
Blades running through my flesh

  

Got no one texting me
But my phone’s on dnd

  

Demons in my mind but am laughing
Terrors at midnight but am smiling

  

A bit over the edge can’t you tell im?
Ego too big it’s spilling

  

Barclays
Say the same thing 20 diff ways
Ill make each one count anyways

  

Good to be us
Turned into a succubus

  

Emotion
Lotion

  

Holding on to couldve beens

  

Intend to
Switch like nintendo

  

Issue with trust

  

Hell bent on revenge

  

Left me for dead
Crawled outta my grave better be ready and set

  

Comodo- ty
Comodo- dragon

  

React 
Tesseract 


عكس كل الاحتمالات و ضد كل الحسابات و على جسة المنطق 


Labile/stable

  

Anvil on a house of cards

  

Only bottom amma be hitting is if its sodomy





Fly high thunder in the sky

  

Too soon
Dead by next june

  

Jacked as sparrow
Hollow
Sorrow

  

Void in my heart
Shot by a dart

  

Pain healin
Anger Spillin

  

Denizen

  

Distress signals


Checkers chess

  

Had it all
Stare the fall

  

Only motive’s destruction, aatrox

  

Smoke you faster than a Rari

Charm you like ahri

  

Lost in an impossible quest
No checkpoint to reload to aint blessed
With that option to get unstressed

  

Psycho
Wherever i go

  

Got issues caused by my father

  

Let you in
Love pay dividends 

  

Smell of the sea salty

  

Others by theira ctions us by our intentions

  

Youre not brave you merely forgot the fear of death allow me to reacquaint you

  

Try fix a heart you didn’t break

  

Voices ringin
Chains clingin

  

(On “loser” rhyme)
I dont wanna loooooooose control
Hell’s lettin loose inside my mind

  

Need one more lie
Lost in the light

  

Didnt believe in my success?
Well now youre sucking on this
