Two o (20)
They were right saying dont meet your hero
And to S sorry I had to let you go

21 
smth smth done

22, 23, 24 the hell am i even doing this fir anymore

Yea I’m broken, yea I’m shattered
Yea I’m betrayed, yea I’m battered 
Yea I’m lost, yea I’m scattered
Yea I’m alone and nothing I’ve done ever mattered
Still even on my knees, you looking at me’s break neck
My week’s worth your yearly check
Hottest in town even your girl’s on deck
Don’t cross me I’m crazy you’re dome might just get hit with this blick
Their arsenal’s a tickle yea i ain’t even nicked
Yea that crown’s ending up on my head and their blood on it

The past few years been really rough on me
Pushed through them with quite the difficulty
They didn’t answer my pleas

So if you please
Am not asking for wealth or the cure to a disease
Not asking for love or a vacation overseas
Am asking for a release
For this shit storm to cease
Not down on my knees but
I just…

wanna feel like I’m changin things to a degree
Where i at least am feelin some sorta relief
Not askin for guarantees
Just reassurance that what I’m buildin with all this debris
Isn’t just me fuelin more anarchy

Wanna see a shore to this endless sea
An end to this fire inside of me
Was pushing me now choking ‘n burning me down I can’t breathe 

So if you please
Am not asking for wealth nor the cure for a disease
Not asking for love or a vacation overseas 
Asking for a release
For this shit storm to cease
Not down on my knees but
I just…

I wanna be freed
From the guilt the fear the anxiety
Takin over me
Every dream’s six feet deep
But so long to the kid I used to be
This me ain’t too weak
To make it through another year
So through any tragedies ‘n RIPs
Im holding on to the end of this journey 
Ill face what i can and can’t foresee
‘N as long as this body doesnt give up on me
Ain’t shit breaking me
