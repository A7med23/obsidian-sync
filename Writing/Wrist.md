Light. Very bright, very white. Blindingly so. I try to close my eyes to save them but my eyelids seem to have already been unopened.

I opened my eyes and a void of darkness devoured the world around me. (Metaphor to dreams being the light i live in and reality being darkness)

My left arm hurting (through out the story the pain gets more and more localized to the wrist)

Can feel my lungs expand and deflate but cant feel air come in or out

My eyes dart around butâ€¦ no change in colors. No sounds. Nothing but nothing.

Suddenly a snap radiates through the sensory void 

Colors start seeping through my feet filling what seems to be a room around me with color

Then it shows a corridor that looks familiar(its my childhood home)

Take the story through scenes with dialogue 

Why does my arm hurt eo bad? You jnow the answer ure just running away from it. Conpare it to my soul hurting

Wake up to rain hitting my face in the end and it turns out to be her crying
