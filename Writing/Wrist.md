Light. Very bright, very white. Blindingly so. I try to close my eyes to save them but my eyelids seem to have already been unopened.

I opened my eyes and a void of darkness devoured the world around me. (Metaphor to dreams being the light i live in and reality being darkness)

My left arm hurting (through out the story the pain gets more and more localized to the wrist)
