Light. Very bright, very white. Blindingly so. I try to close my eyes to save them but my eyelids seem to have already been unopened.

I opened my eyes and a void of darkness devoured the world around me. (Metaphor to dreams being the light i live in and reality being darkness)

My left arm hurting (through out the story the pain gets more and more localized to the wrist)

Can feel my lungs expand and deflate but cant feel air come in or out

My eyes dart around but… no change in colors. No sounds. Nothing but nothing.

Suddenly a snap radiates through the sensory void 

Colors start seeping through my feet filling what seems to be a room around me with color

Then it shows a corridor that looks familiar(its my childhood home)

Take the story through scenes with dialogue 

Why does my arm hurt eo bad? You jnow the answer ure just running away from it. Conpare it to my soul hurting

You can keep building rooms here, trapping memories inside them. Or you can go back, summon those damn demons, and end them once and for all.

*it starts raining*

“Why’re you making it rain?”. im not. You always felt comfortable in the rain. You run to it like you want it to cleanse you. It’s why you do what you do. It’s how you walk through hell. It’s where you feel at home.

Wake up to rain hitting my face in the end and it turns out to be her crying

- need to establish the things that caused those “traumas”:
- seeking Unconditional love (away from grades)
- over-chasing providing and protecting those i love causing self neglect and mistaking that for purpose
