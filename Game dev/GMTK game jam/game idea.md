## 🎯 **Core Concept**

You are trapped inside your own mind, reliving a **looped sequence of memories** — a mix of joyful, traumatic, and mysterious moments. Each run represents a playthrough of those memories.

You aim to:

- **Recover lost memories**
    
- **Alter the past**
    
- **Break the loop** by building a deck that can **confront and resolve** your core trauma or truth.

## ♻️ **Core Loop**

1. **Enter a Memory Sequence** (3–5 "encounters" per loop)
    
2. **Face internal conflicts** (manifested as enemies: guilt, denial, anger, etc.)
    
3. **Play cards** to resolve encounters (attack, support, recall, reframe, suppress)
    
4. **End the Loop** — depending on performance:
    
    - Keep 1–2 cards
        
    - Forget 1–2 cards
        
    - Unlock a **Memory Fragment** (new passive, new card, or new event)
        
5. **Begin again**, stronger and more aware

## 🃏 **Card System**

### **Card Types**

- 🟥 **Emotion** (Attack-style cards): Represent raw feelings — rage, fear, sorrow.
    
- 🟦 **Memory** (Support/utility): Recall past moments for buffs, insight, or clarity.
    
- 🟨 **Cognition** (Control-style): Allow you to suppress, reframe, or alter other cards/events.
    

### **Card Mechanics**

- Some cards are unstable: they **change meaning or effect each loop**.
    
- Others are **"ghosts"** — faint memories you can’t use until you unlock their truth.
    

### **Example Cards**

| Name              | Type      | Effect                                               |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "Repressed Anger" | Emotion   | Deal 8 damage. Grows by 2 each loop.                 |
| "Mother’s Voice"  | Memory    | Heal 5. Permanently retained.                        |
| "Disassociation"  | Cognition | Exile a card this loop. Gain 1 Clarity.              |
| "Loop Anchor"     | Special   | Prevent this card from resetting. Keep it next loop. |

## 🧩 **Narrative Progression**

- Each loop gives **context**: snippets of a forgotten event or turning point in your life.
    
- You choose which memories to explore each loop: childhood, betrayal, death, failure, etc.
    
- Unlocking and reshaping memories opens new story branches.

## 🧠 **Loop Meta-System**

### 🌀 **Loop Stability**

- Each run affects your **Mind Stability**.
    
- Use too many unstable cards or suppress too many emotions and your deck becomes erratic.
    
- Maintain balance or risk “Corrupted Loops” — distorted versions of the memory with new challenges.
    

### 🔓 **Persistent Unlocks**

- Passive abilities called **“Core Beliefs”**
    
    - E.g., “I Deserve Forgiveness” → first Emotion card you play each loop costs 0.
        
- New starting decks: “Denial Build,” “Overthinker Build,” “The Victim,” etc.

## 👁️‍🗨️ **Visual Style**

- Hand-drawn or painterly art — surreal, fragmented environments.
    
- Enemies are abstract or symbolic: an unrecognizable face, a mirror that fights back, a bleeding clock.
    
- UI is memory-like: faded text, shifting interface elements.

## 🧩 **Inspirations**

- _Inscryption_ (meta progression + surreal tone)
    
- _Gris_ (emotional themes)
    
- _Slay the Spire_ (tight deck mechanics)
    
- _The Forgotten City_ (looping + narrative layering)

## 🔚 **Endgame**

- Final loop is a **reconstructed timeline** — all memories in one continuous sequence.
    
- You face a “Boss Memory” — a person/event you couldn’t face before.
    
- You can choose to:
    
    - Accept and move forward
        
    - Rewrite your own memory
        
    - Or stay in the loop...
