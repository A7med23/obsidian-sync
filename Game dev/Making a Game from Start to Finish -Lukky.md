# Planning and Setup
1- Make a board with 4 columns:
- todo
- doing
- stuck
- done

> make sure cards are 1-2 hours long to not get stuck on them for too long but also not too short that the system is redundant

 >make sure that after youre done with the cards that after you move them all to the done section you do have a fully made game

> color code the cards (a color for the asset part, a color for UI, a color for game mechanics, etc etc)

2- Make assets folder and others folder and make a github repository for it
 assets include:
 - textures
 - sounds
 - font
 - models
 - sprites

MAKE THE ASSETS FOLDER SEPARATE FROM THE GAME FOLDER

3- Make the game
