# Interpretation of Critters

- pokemon like game where you capture different creatures 
- a game where you combine creatures and use them to fight

- a mining colony game where you mine a planet's resources using it's critters -> different critters have different mining levels or different abilities that make them able to obtain different resources. (rage room theme)

- player absorbs abilities from critters and uses them in combat

- destroying critters


- an idle game where you nurture and grow an empire of a certain species (an ant colony builder):
	- can do the same idea with Bees!!
	
	- the item quick time even is an attack from another species
	
	- you can start as an ant on a grid based generated level
	  
	- maybe overground and underground turns?
		- overground you gather resources (left over food from humans at a park or whatever):
			- have limited turns/actions when overground OR LIMITED TIME (that's the wild card)
			  
			- 
			  
		- underground use the resources to expand the empire:
			- after running out of resources to spend (or choosing to end turn) -> turn ends
			  
			- resources used to:
				- spawn different types of the critter (collecter or warrior or support)
				- upgrade the critters
				- upgrade storage
