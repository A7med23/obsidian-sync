* only 100x with very tight stop losses (aka only take the greediest levels)
* this is his first trade he took the final move of this as it already had laddered and above that was a wick covering the entire thing making it polarized![[Pasted image 20240106194319.png]]
* he exited early at 20556 to lock up profits so he could be able to re enter and if he gets stopped he is just forfeiting the profits he got not his main account
* in this trade he entered on the yellow line and exited the second it got too risky![[Pasted image 20240106195154.png]]
* the priority is to NOT LOSE MONEY. profits come later.
* LEARN NOT TO LOSE MONEY
