They always end up running and I don't mind  
Say I’m too intense, on all the time  
I can see it growing, fear in their eyes  
But you look like a fighter

You say you like ‘em crazy  
Then I'm just your type  
Promise you'll keep up with what I like  
You’ll probably crash and burn  
But what's a try?  
Head first into the free fall

I'm feeling like a criminal  
I want you to be too  
The taste of your blood has got me worked up  
Evil things I wanna do

And now I have locked my sights on you  
Too late to run and hide  
I wish you the best cause  
Now that you're mine  
Odds are you won't survive, uh

Too late to, too late to

You're rolling with the best  
Can you keep my pace?  
Greedy for your touch, and I can't be tamed  
There's a million reasons you should run away  
But you look like a fighter

I’ll show you the best views  
Unreachable heights  
Elevate the stakes to see if you will rise  
(you’ll rise)  
Can you take the pressure? Will  
You learn to fly?  
Head first into the free fall

I'm feeling like a criminal  
I want you to be too  
(I want you, I want you)  
The taste of your blood has got me worked up  
Evil things I wanna do

And now I have locked my sights on you  
Too late to run and hide  
I wish you the best cause  
Now that you’re mine  
Odds are you won't survive

And now I have locked my sights on you  
Too late to run and hide  
(Too late to, too late to)  
I wish you the best cause  
Now that you're mine  
Odds are you won't survive, uh

Too late to, too late to wish you the best  
Odds are you won’t survive
