Think the painter was bad?
Well let me draw you this picture
A land taken despite being forbidden by their scripture
A sieged border relentlessly bombed
Fires blaze neither safe inside nor out in the open
How different is that really from an oven

Think u can play god without permission?
Killing and bombing those children
Behold all out war for each of their cries
Shoot, bomb, nuke we don’t die
Martyrs marching six feet deep
Don't think your soldiers seeing ghosts is a bit weird?

Truths in plain sight but they’re denying
Own the banks and the media, still caught lying
Leaders caught with pants down ain’t got nothing to do
But sooner or later you’ll be a relic of the past, yahoo
