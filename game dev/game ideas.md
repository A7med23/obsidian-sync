### alone in the dark
you play as a character and your mouse controls a light 
you use that light to navigate around the map
possible obstacles: 
- things that spawn in the dark and are pushed away with light so you need to have the cursor on your self to protect yourself from them
- can have a i am legend reference
- having to navigate the terrain while protecting yourself form the things at the same time
