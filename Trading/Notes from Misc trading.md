1) if price is dumping and rthe next base to catch it is a market structure higher low that created a higher high, price should react at it and not go through ![[Pasted image 20240103004207.png]] 
2) there is wick tests where you can go inside the candle and maybe find smth
3) and there a candle that its body gets tested which kinda fully negates it

4) when it comes to break outs: identify where the final 1m hold is, adapt your trends to see the failures in trends, find the origin or base holding the move up (the example showed 1min), when it gets hard closed and also fails the trend short it and have the final hold as the minimum target.![[Pasted image 20240104150345.png]] 
5) move stop to entry once the price moves down because final holds are crazy sometimes.![[Pasted image 20240104150438.png]]
6) the longer a candle is left a lone and the more the price is above/under it the stronger it gets
7) always long the final 1m hold and/or the final 1m break

8) always mark out your ranges, the breaks from highest TFs down
9) when price is pumping or dumping really hard, mostly you want to take the breaks.
10) hold levels are very good when youre accuming or distributing or going sideways (because theyre good for the price to use to range) or when theyre the final holds.
